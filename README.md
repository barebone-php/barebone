### Models

Define your models as needed in `/app/classes/Model`

### Controllers

Write your controller actions in `/app/classes/Controller`

### Views

Add as many views as referenced in your controllers in `/app/views`.

### Routing

Connect your controller actions to urls in `routes.php`

### Logging

You can write from models and controllers to a log in `/app/logs/`

### Frontend

### Hosting

## Status

This is an early build. There are no tests yet and the API may change.
But i am pretty confident that i am close to finalizing the MVC. In the next
updates i will focus on enhancements like Session handling.
